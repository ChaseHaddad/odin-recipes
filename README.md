# odin-recipes
This Project is an extremely simple web page that uses links to other pages to showcase some of my favorite recipes along with pictures of them. This projects purpose was to put to use and practice the basic html, git, and terminal skills that i have acquired through The Odin Project-Foundations course. Such as creating directories, files, renaming and moving said files and staging, committing, and pushing to git through the terminal. In addition i created html files that contained basic structure using lists, images, links, and headers to create each individual page and allow navigation to and from the homepage. This project was a short, simple, and good way for me to get some repetitions in of basic html pages, and familiarizing myself with github and my terminal. For now this project is finished, but may recieve updates in the future to practice new skills I learn.
